## Project Overview

This project features a simple HTML form designed to collect user information. The form includes fields for a user's full name, father's name, email address, phone number, subject, and a message. Although the form is not functional (i.e., it doesn't process submissions), it serves as a demonstration of fundamental HTML form elements.
